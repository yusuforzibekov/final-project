# Fundamentals of Web Development Final Project

## Task Requirements

1. Please, place all your `SCSS` styles in `src/styles` folder.
2. The `package.json` file is already created, please don't delete NPM scripts that are already there. This file should look like this when you initiate the project:

   ```json
   {
      "scripts" {
         "test": "jest --reporters=jest-junit",
         "build": "echo \"Dummy build script for Autocode\""
      }
   }
   ```

   Also, there are some preinstalled service dependencies that are required for automatic verification of your task, please don't remove them either.

3. Your main HTML page should be named `index.html` and be placed `src/index.html`.
4. Root files for regular and mobile styles have to have names `style.scss` and `mobile.scss` and be placed inside `src/styles` folder. These names are used for automatic checks.
5. All the result CSS files have to be in `dist` folder.
   - result styles should be in `src/dist/style.css`
   - result minified styles should be in `src/dist/style.min.css`
